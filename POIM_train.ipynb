            " (서울=연합뉴스) 안채원 기자 = 신당 창당을 준비 중인 국민의힘 이준석 전 대표가 온라인으로 내년 총선 출마 희망자를 모집한다.  이 전 대표는 3일 연합뉴스와 통화에서 \"총선에 관심 있는 사람들을 알아보고자 한다\"며 \"이번 주 중 온라인으로 모집을 공지할 예정\"이라고 밝혔다.  지난달 '지지자 연락망' 구축을 위해 활용했던 인터넷 '구글 폼'을 이용해 이번에는 '출마 의향자 리스트'를 만들겠다는 구상이다.  이를 두고 이 전 대표가 신당 창당 의사를 굳히고 총선 인재 모집에 나선 것이란 해석이 나온다.  이 전 대표는 지난달 29일 페이스북에 \"만약 신당이 추진된다면 이미 종로에 나서고 싶어 하는 인사가 있는 것은 사실\"이라고 적기도 했다.\n",
